# Functions to write

- differential power of a primary monomial ideal (done - needs testing)
- differential power of any monomial ideal (done)
- differential power of any ideal in a polynomial ring
- given any I and n, minimal d such that `I^{<dn>}` is contained in `I^n` (at least for I a monomial ideal)
- write some other stuff
